            Playing the game, you level up. The maximum level you can get is 500. Every time you level up, you get an apex pack, that gives you skins for Legends or for the weapons.
            There is also a chance to get a

            heirloom 
          </a>
            (melee skin) for 1 legend. The chance for getting that is 0.2% so you can get it guaranteed at 500 packs. 
            Normally, if you punch in this game, you punch with your fists but with a heirloom you can stab them with a butterfly knife for example. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Every season in apex is 3-4 months. Every month, comes a new Legends(character). There is also a battlepass for skins, emotes and apex packs. The battlepass costs 10 euro but, you can buy the next battlepass for free if you complete it. 
          </p>

          <p>
            There is also a Event every season. Every event brings out a new heirloom for a legend. In the event, you can buy special Apex packs for limited time skins and if you get them all, you can get the new heirloom.
